<h2>
<em>LEGION MAGAZINE</em> MARCH/APRIL 2016</h2>
<p>COVER FEATURE:<br> <strong>ILL-FATED TRENCH RAIDERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Royal Newfoundland Regiment</strong> has a storied past, but of all the stories, none is as captivating or tragic as its advance during the Battle of the Somme on July 1, 1916. The regiment’s first call to action on the Western Front was for two trench raids before the full-scale attack planned for July 1. Their mission was to assess the strength of the German line and bring back a prisoner. Although they failed to take a prisoner, the raiding party reported that a preceding weeklong artillery bombardment of the lines here had little impact on German preparedness and numbers. But by now, the massive British war machine was in full swing, and in the overconfidence that was the hallmark of the colossal failure on July 1, no thought was given to abandoning the attack. To read more of Frank Gogos’s story of the Newfoundland Regiment at Beaumont-Hamel, pick up the March/April 2016 issue.</p>
<p>Also in the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>H<strong>ow I survived at the Somme</strong>: A Newfoundland Regiment soldier recounts the 1916 tragedy that was Beaumont-Hamel</li>

<p><br><strong>Canada's Ultimate Story continues with the fourth instalment of the award-winning series.</strong><br>The most famous decoration for courage in the western world, the Victoria Cross, has been awarded to dozens of Canadians. To mark this incredible history, Legion Magazine has published a colourful special edition that— through words and pictures—highlights Canada’s remarkable place within the Victoria Cross story.</p>
<p>The lore behind the VC is sprinkled with strange and heart-wrenching stories. Victoria Crosses have been cherished, stolen, lost, recovered, sold and even pawned. Some recipients attained high office; some died in poverty.</p>
<p>Legion Magazine’s 100-page special edition includes bonus posters, a timeline and maps showing where Canadian VCs were earned around the world. Historian/author Hugh A. Halliday describes how the award evolved and how it was earned through individual acts of valour and self-sacrifice on land, at sea and in the air. <br><br><strong>Includes a Free Victoria Cross Poster!</strong></p>

<p><span> </span><br><span>COVER FEATURE</span><br><strong>GOING BACK TO GALLIPOLI</strong><span></span></p>
<div>
<br><strong>“For a long time</strong>, historians thought the original Caribou Hill was inaccessible,” historian Frank Gogos told a delegation from Newfoundland visiting Turkey last September. The hill was a battlefield position taken and reinforced by the Newfoundland Regiment in 1915, and was christened Caribou Hill after the emblem on the regiment’s badge. “The regiment left Gallipoli and no markers remained to say where it was.” But Gogos has determined that one of the roads in today’s Gallipoli Peninsula Historical National Park intersects with the hill. The discovery of the famed Caribou Hill was a highlight the pilgrimage, a century after the first overseas engagement for the regiment, deployed with 29th Division in Britain’s failed attack on the strategic Gallipoli Peninsula in the Ottoman Empire (today’s Turkey). Tom MacGregor’s story of the pilgrimage leads off the January/February 2016 issue.</div>

Its colour reminded soldiers of the blood lost on that very ground, and inspired Canadian John McCrae to write his famous poem, In Flanders Fields.   </span></p>

</h4>
<p class=""p1"">The latest special issue from <i>Legion Magazine</i> is “Twenty-Five Great Canadian Aviators,” a special collector’s edition packed with compelling stories, stunning photos and detailed maps.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><strong>Who are the leading lights</strong> in Canada’s great aviation heritage? The question has been asked often, but there seem to be no easy answers, and no single list will please every aficionado.</p>
<p><em>Legion Magazine</em>’s latest special-interest publication—25 Great Canadian Aviators—represents a valiant effort to compile a list of 25 great and groundbreaking Canadian aviators.</p>
<p>Few people will quibble over Canada’s most iconic aviation celebrities. J.A.D. McCurdy of Silver Dart fame will appear on many a list, along with such other obvious choices as renowned fighter aces Billy Bishop and George “Buzz” Beurling, bush-flying pioneer “Punch” Dickins, Avro Arrow test pilot Jan Zurakowski and world-renowned astronaut Chris Hadfield.</p>
<p>But what we have compiled is a mix of national aviation celebrities with some less well-known names. Each has made important contributions to Canada’s aviation scene. Among the First World War airmen, you’ll certainly recognize William G. Barker, but not likely Edward O’Leary. From the Second World War, you’ll likely know David Hornell, but maybe not W.H.D. Meaden.</p>
<p>Pick up a copy of <em>Legion Magazine’s 25 Great Canadian Aviators</em> on the newsstand to see what you think of these 25, and then have fun compiling your own list and post it here at <strong>www.legionmagazine.com/aviators</strong>.</p>

<p><em>LEGION MAGAZINE</em> NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2015 <br>REMEMBRANCE FEATURES: </p>
<p><strong>MESSAGES TO THE FALLEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inspired by</strong> John McCrae’s “In Flanders Fields”—composed a century ago—a collection of new essays by prominent Canadian authors inspires us to remember. “Messages to the living, messages to the dead,” by acclaimed writer Frances Itani, leads off the November/December 2015 issue’s special remembrance package, and is followed by “Two wars in two weeks,” tracing the travels of pilgrims from across Canada who visited battlefields, cemeteries and memorials in France, Belgium and the Netherlands in July.</p>
<p>Also in the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Canadian Armed Forces has a new leader. General Jonathan Vance takes charge of a military at war</li>
<li>Clearing the Canol Road: After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, a top-secret plan was developed by the United States to build a pipeline and road from Norman Wells, N.W.T., to Whitehorse</li>
<li>What was the pivotal moment of Churchill’s military and political career? Two Churchillophiles face off</li>
<li>Who owns Arctic waterways … and the resources that lie beneath the ocean ice?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“The Anxious Dead”</strong></p>
<p>“The Anxious Dead” is believed to be the last poem written by soldier-doctor-poet John McCrae. It was published in <i>The London Spectator</i> in September 1917, just four months before McCrae died, but when it is was written is uncertain. Unlike the more famous “In Flanders Fields,” the poem does not deal with a specific war or battle but with the sentiment of soldiers who fall in battle needing to know that their comrades carried on to victory.</p>

<p><strong>“The Anxious Dead”</strong></p>
<p>“The Anxious Dead” is believed to be the last poem written by soldier-doctor-poet John McCrae. It was published in <i>The London Spectator</i> in September 1917, just four months before McCrae died, but when it is was written is uncertain. Unlike the more famous “In Flanders Fields,” the poem does not deal with a specific war or battle but with the sentiment of soldiers who fall in battle needing to know that their comrades carried on to victory.<br><br><strong></strong></p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><strong><strong><em>Forget-me-not as s</em></strong>ymbol of remembrance</strong><br>The forget-me-not was adopted as the flower of remembrance by the people of Newfoundland following the devastating losses suffered by the Newfoundland Regiment at Beaumont-Hamel in France during the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Like the poppy in Canada, fabric forget-me-nots were made by disabled servicemen to raise money for needy veterans leading up to Memorial Day on July 1. </p>

<p class=""p1""><em>I have spent many an evening in Grandpa’s home in Windsor, Ont., with him sitting in his recliner and me on the couch. Before too long a conversation would start up, with me asking about the war. What emerged were remarkable stories of a young sailor at sea far from home, back in the days of daily rum tots, torpedoed merchant ships and depth charge attacks. Thomas Joseph Simpson—Grandpa to me—served in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) during the Battle of the Atlantic, and his story, like that of thousands of others, is one of service, sacrifice and survival. Grandpa’s role, and his burden, more than 70 years later, has been to see that those who did not return are remembered as true heroes. “I’m no hero,” he says. “All the real heroes call the ocean their grave.” </em>Read the rest of this touching personal memoir, and more, in the September/October 2015 issue of <em>Legion Magazine</em>. </p>

<p class=""p1""><b>Cracks in the system, <em>part two</em>: Broken faith<br></b>Soldiers accept the risk of death or injury, particularly when they’re in a combat zone. What is hard to accept though, and what they barely consider when in a combat zone, is what their life will be like if they return home wounded. They’d expect, at least, to be treated with care and respect. Canada’s system for compensating and caring for these veterans is imperfect; it has gaps, it may even be broken. And while everyone knows there is a problem—military leaders, politicians, bureaucrats, the public—the problem remains. <br><b></b></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">More than 100 Canadians served with the 3,000 pilots of the Royal Air Force who repulsed the attacks in dramatic air battles, turning the tide of the war. More than 500 aviators died, including 29 Canadians.</span></p>

<p>The Fight for Italy is packed with compelling stories, stunning photos and detailed maps about the Italian Campaign waged by Allied forces from July 1943 to February 1945. More than 92,000 Canadians served in Italy and more than 5,700 died, but the campaign was largely overshadowed by the invasion of Normandy. Now, 70 years after the critical Allied victories on Sicily and the Italian mainland, “The Fight for Italy” will take you back to relive those battles.</p>

The Battle of the Somme continued for more than four months and more than 1.3 million soldiers on both sides were killed or wounded. Through a virtual battlefield tour, timelines, maps, photos, and video of the battlefield today, <em>Legion Magazine</em> recalls the sacrifices of the soldiers, placing the events of Beaumont-Hamel into the context of the Battle of the Somme and the greater war.</p>

On Oct. 15, he was struck by two German bullets. His twin brother, in another trench just 50 kilometres away, was hit by a sniper’s shot on Nov. 11. As the Great War came to a close, one would perish, and one would survive. <br> <br><strong>War After War</strong><br>Operation Reassurance was Canada’s contribution to a multinational naval patrol on the Black Sea, intended to signal NATO’s resolve in the face of Vladimir Putin’s increasingly aggressive posturing. Staff Writer Adam Day boards the frigate HMCS Toronto to see where we stand with Russia, and to explore how nations can be dragged, reluctantly, into dangerous conflicts.<br><br><strong>Operation Keepsake</strong><br>Thousands of sentimental gifts and handcrafted keepsakes have been sent by family and friends at home to the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces over the 13-year deployment in Afghanistan. Now many of those items of support are coming home for public display, thanks to the efforts of two passionate collectors. <br><br><strong>Legion Urges Government Action On New Veterans Charter</strong> <br>“Our injured veterans and their families cannot wait any longer,” said Tom Eagles, Dominion President of The Royal Canadian Legion, as he launched a new letter-writing campaign urging the federal government to act quickly to implement substantive changes to the New Veterans Charter. “The Legion does not believe the delay is justified.”<br><br></p>

liberating-normandy,Liberating Normandy,"<h2><span style=""color: #cc0000;"">Canada's Ultimate Story On Liberating Normandy</span></h2>
<p><br><strong>Canada’s Ultimate Story continues with the fifth instalment of the award-winning series.</strong><br>The Battle of Normandy was the beginning of the end of the Second World War in Northwest Europe. Canadian soldiers, sailors and airmen helped turn the tide towards victory when they landed on Juno Beach and won hard-fought battles against a determined enemy in the summer of 1944.

<p><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 20px;""></span></strong></span>One hundred years ago, Canada and many other nations were pulled into a cataclysm that left some 10 million dead. Nearly 620,000 Canadians—from a country of less than eight million—served during the war and more than 66,600 died. In a special feature, renowned historian Donald E. Graves explains how a young country far from the crisis in Europe got involved in such a tragic and bloody conflagration.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15px;"">All across Canada—in living room corners, attics and spare bedrooms—there are artifacts from this country’s long and sometimes tough history. The results of our Historymakers’ Contest prove just how much Canadians cherish their wartime artifacts. The winning entries, as noted by award-winning Staff Writer Adam Day, include artifacts and souvenirs passed down by a Canadian soldier who served in the Boer War and First World War to a Nazi flag that helped save the life of a Canadian airman during the Second World War.  </p>

<p><br><strong> Canada's Ultimate Story continues with the fourth instalment of the award-winning series.</strong><br> The most famous decoration for courage in the western world, the Victoria Cross, has been awarded to dozens of Canadians. To mark this incredible history, Legion Magazine has published a colourful special edition that— through words and pictures—highlights Canada’s remarkable place within the Victoria Cross story.</p>
<p>The lore behind the VC is sprinkled with strange and heart-wrenching stories. Victoria Crosses have been cherished, stolen, lost, recovered, sold and even pawned. Some recipients attained high office; some died in poverty.</p>
<p>Legion Magazine’s 100-page special edition includes bonus posters, a timeline and maps showing where Canadian VCs were earned around the world. Historian/author Hugh A. Halliday describes how the award evolved and how it was earned through individual acts of valour and self-sacrifice on land, at sea and in the air. <br><br><strong>Includes a Free Victoria Cross Poster!</strong></p>
